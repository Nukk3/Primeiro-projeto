<p>Linkin Park -  CRAWLING</p>
<p>Crawling in my skin
    These wounds, they will not heal
    Fear is how I fall
    Confusing what is real
    
    There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
    Consuming, confusing
    This lack of self-control, I fear, is never-ending
    Controlling, I can't seem
    
    To find myself again, my walls are closing in
    Without a sense of confidence
    I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
    I've felt this way before, so insecure

    Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
    Distracting (distracting), reacting
    Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (my own reflection)
    It's haunting (it's haunting) how I can't seem
